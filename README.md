# Wallet-Website

You can view the website here: https://dariiing.github.io/Wallet-Website/

This is a website where you can keep track of your money (spendings and incomes), and you also have the option to add items to a To Buy/Pay list so you don't forget about them. You can see the statistics of how much you've spent this month ( you also have the option to reset your expenses data and have a fresh start again).
